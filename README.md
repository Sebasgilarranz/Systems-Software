# Systems-Software
The purpose of the course is to design and development compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders. Basic operating systems will be covered as well as brief introductions to advanced topics such as optimization, software security, and program analysis.

### Simplec
In this project, you will be writing your own compiler for a simplified C-like language called SimpleC. A compiler translates program written a source language such as C to a target language, such as Intel x86 machine code. Our compiler's source language is SimpleC, defined over the semester in five projects, and its target language the intermediate representation (IR) of the LLVM compiler framework. LLVM is an industry-standard compiler framework that backs the clang C/C++ compiler, swift, and several other projects. The LLVM IR bridges the gap between source language and machine code, allowing new languages to be developed more rapidly by exploiting existing optimization and machine code generation.

The finished project can be found in the Simplec folder.
